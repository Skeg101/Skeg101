# Welcome 👋

## Introduction
My name is Oakley and username is Skeg101. I am currently studying a certificate IV in Cyber Security with the goal of learning some coding and about physical cyber security.

## Interests
I love watching movies like Interstellar and Scott Pilgrim vs the World. So excited for the new Christopher Nolan movie next year 😄. I also play the bass guitar and love listening to all types of music, ranging from Iron Maiden to Kool & the Gang to
Babymetal. Keeping up and learning about the latest tech hardware and software is a big interest of mine, with learning about Linux (CachyOS specifically) being my new favourite thing as I moved from Windows 10 to it.
